# Online-Attendance-Marking-Using-Face-Recognition
"EFFORTLESS,SECURE, and AUTOMATED ATTNDANCE MARKING USING FACE RECOGNITION"

📌OVERVIEW: This project is an automated attendance system that utilizes facial recognition to mark the attendance and to reduce the burder of Traditional attendace marking. It eliminates manual attendance marking, reduces proxy attendance, and improves efficiency using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

🧰FEATURES: ✅ Face detection & Recognition: Using OpenCV and ML for accuracte fac recognition ✅ Automated Attendance Marking: Detects and records attendance in real-time. ✅ Database Integration: Stores attendance records using Firebase ✅ Web-Based Interface: Users can access attendance reports from anywhere ✅ Security & Privacy: Implements encryption and authentication measures.
